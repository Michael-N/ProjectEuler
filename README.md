# ProjectEuler
- The only way to learn to code is to code and to code a lot hence this is my progress on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- A majority of the code is & will be written in Python 3
- *Note!* libraries other than those which come default with Python will *not* be used
  *unless* I have already written a roughly equivilant library for the task in previous
   Project Euler Questions. (the DRY principal)
- As data is sometimes provided for a problem the convention has been to use *one file* named  ```<number here>_number.txt``` where the ```<number here>``` is substituted with the number of the curent problem.
